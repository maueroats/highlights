## Racket

A number of small improvements:

* [Apply spelling canonicalization to colors](https://github.com/racket/picturing-programs/pull/3) in the Picturing Programs library.
* [Clarify documentation for add-online-expansion-handler](https://github.com/racket/drracket/pull/401)
* [Fix a contract violation when running Typed Racket](https://github.com/racket/racket/pull/3312)
* [Clarify the usage of rest arguments](https://github.com/racket/typed-racket/pull/947) after a user had problems understanding them.
* [Improve appearance of error messages](https://github.com/racket/typed-racket/pull/946) that were confusing to a beginner.
* [Equality involving NaN had incorrect typing](https://github.com/racket/typed-racket/pull/945). **Good writeup.**

One [long discussion](https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/3104) of behavior in the `random-sample` code that I felt was incorrect, or at least unexpected enough that it should be changed.
